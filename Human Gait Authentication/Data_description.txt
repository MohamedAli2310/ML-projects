The dataset contains arm movement patterns from 5 users collected using a smartwatch.
Every folder has 2 subfolders, one contains the data for training and another for testing.
Every Training and Testing folder has three files, namely, Accelerometer_Data.txt, Gyroscope_Data.txt, and Profile.txt.
As the names suggest Accelerometer_Data.txt contains Accelerometer Readings, Gyroscope_Data.txt contains gyroscope readings,
whereas, Profile contains, Age, Gender, and the dominant hand.

The columns in the data files (e.g, Accelerometer_Data.txt) are as follows:

<AccX, AccY, AccZ, Timestamps>
